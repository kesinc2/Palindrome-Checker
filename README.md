# Palindrome Checker

A simple and elegant web application to check if a word or phrase is a palindrome.

## What is a Palindrome?

A palindrome is a word, number, or phrase that reads the same forward and backward. For example, "madam," "racecar," or "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama."

This project is a simple tool built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to determine if a given string is a palindrome.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The interface is clean, centered, and works well on different screen sizes.
- **Real-time Check:** The application instantly tells you whether your input is a palindrome.
- **Case and Space Insensitive:** The check ignores uppercase/lowercase letters and spaces, so inputs like "Madam" or "A man a plan a canal panama" are correctly identified.
- **User-Friendly:** A clear explanation of what a palindrome is is included on the page.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the page structure.
- **CSS3:** For styling and a clean layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** For the core logic and functionality.
